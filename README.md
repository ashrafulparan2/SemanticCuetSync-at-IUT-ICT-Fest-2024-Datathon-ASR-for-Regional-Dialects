# SemanticCuetSync-at-IUT-ICT-Fest-2024-Datathon-ASR-for-Regional-Dialects


The use of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems in human-computer interaction is vital, but because
these systems are trained on standard language datasets, they
frequently have difficulty distinguishing regional dialects. We
tackle this problem in our work by concentrating on Bengali
Speech Recognition for Regional Dialects. We adjust the OpenAI
Whisper small model by fine-tuning its hyperparameters. Our
finetuned model achieved 5th rank with private score of 0.75438.
